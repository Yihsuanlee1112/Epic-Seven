         "story": "We fairies of the forest are heralds of the Creator. Like other fairies, Krixi could often be found dancing in flowerbeds or playing with the animals. However, whenever danger draws near, Krixi's cruel side would emerge in full force. She would use her sharp fangs and claws to shred any demon who intrudes upon the forest. What really broke Krixi's heart was seeing the humans, whom she once considered her companions, destroying the forest for material wealth. Their armies were highly organized and armed to the teeth, so Krixi gathered the inhabitants of the forest in an effort to fight off the human invaders. The plan worked, and she was able to coerce the humans into signing a peace treaty. The forest quickly returned to its peaceful and serene state, but Krixi knew that the invaders' ambitions weren't much different from that of the demons. She began training wild creatures with human methods and formed her own powerful beast army in hopes to prevent future invasions! War has no other purpose than the destruction of life!",

The ritualistic religion quickly filled the void inside Gildur, but being the calculative person that he is, Gildur realized that the fervor was not any different from his previous endeavors; he was in no hurry to leave though. After experiencing a religious life, he realized it could be potentially profitable. The hierarchy within the Temple gave him more reasons to seek power. His wealth quickly paved the way for him to rise through the hierarchy and become one of the most powerful men on the continent. My ambition for power is like a beast uncaged. I am not done.",

Long did she pray and beseech their wisdom, but long have they remained silent.  Eager to prove her mettle, she attempted to take on the Ravagers alone. Surely with their demise by her hand, the Great Ones would reward her with glory. However, it may also be that same hubris that made the Great Ones so disgusted with her. Though she fought bravely and peerlessly, inevitably she was captured. The tortures she suffered need not be mentioned. All that matters was those bright eyes, which once looked up to the heavens for guidance, are now filled with malice and dark fire. Maloch, the leader of the Ravagers, personally performed the tortures, which founded a dark and awful relationship between the two. From then on, she was always by his side, commanding his armies and vanquishing his foes. But she always preferred the silent approach, bringing down the mightiest foes with her wiles and charms. Tome upon tome had been written to warn off men who might ever come across her path to not to listen to the dark shadows whispering promises of greatness; all that lies at the end of that road is doom.  The Queen of Night is patient. She knows ultimately she will always have her way. She will be the last one standing. She still dreams of the day she can bathe in the Great Ones' blood and look them in the eyes, so that they may know her wrath.",

Because of Wukong, Toro's concubine was killed and his son taken away by Boddhisattva Guanyin. We're sworn brothers and we said we would be brothers no matter what. Why is he always messing with me? Toro still loses his mind every time he thinks of these tragic events. Toro wanted to confront Wukong to set things straight, but Wukong had become a Buddha upon finishing his journey. Toro felt inferior. After learning that Wukong was heading to Athanor, Toro seized the opportunity and followed Wukong.

The Princes' abilities provided them with great advantages not easily overpowered. Only the likes of Violet, who had undergone extensive training, could rival these unnatural forces and their magic. The more Princes she killed, the more of a threat she became, and the more her name was known throughout the Princes' ranks. Their collectively seething hatred for Violet amplified their desires to destroy her. It motivated them to commit massive amounts of resources and effort to launch long-distance attacks on her army. Her most powerful weapon was her personal firearm, the Rose of Fate, which won countless battles for her. Unfortunately, it was destroyed by a fireball. Violet immediately became weaker and her army began to falter. This enraged her. She vowed to defeat them at all costs, not allowing the loss of her weapon to prevent that from ever happening.

Life, rules, logic, emotions, and faith meant nothing to him. Any unfortunate souls to come before this sinister being would cower when struck with a feeling more terrifying than the mere meaning of the term. If it hadn't been for a gifted human, who lured Chaugnar into a trap and sealed him in the depths of the Black Sea, this world would have been lost long ago. Yet, the power of chaos could never be exterminated completely. All that a human could do is to fight to weaken Chaugnar, mitigating the threat he posed. However, everyone knew that Chaugnar would eventually break out from his shackles, and his fury would rain upon every corner of this world. I will make you watch as this world is devoured by chaos!",

Yet he was the only living proof of it, and was alienated by this world because of it. The intrigue of Omega's origins were not important, for the more pressing issue was its abilities and their contrasting connotations.

         "story": "“What should I do after the war is over?” On cold nights, Butterfly's sword emits a crimson light that radiates a sense of warmth. “Survival is never easy for people like me, the people who feed on dirt and blood. I have no time to think about anything else,” her cold voice scoffed from the shadows. Even after several straight days of fighting, Butterfly showed no sign of fatigue. As a well-trained mercenary, she is capable of retaining and recovering her stamina throughout an exhausting war. Butterfly was a code name given by her mercenary order. Unlike ordinary, freelance mercenaries, Butterfly was specially trained by the order. As the order's numbers grew, their requests became more complicated as well. Clients started demanding specific requirements of the mercenaries; they insisted on certain abilities, genders, ages, and even appearances. In response, the order assiduously trained Butterfly to cater to the ever-changing requests. According to her contract, Butterfly, as an orphan, was to be raised by the mercenary order and trained in combat. Growing up, she served as a contractor for the association, requiring her to surrender half of the bounty she earned from every assignment as repayment for the order's investment on her, at least until her debt was cleared. Thanks to her efficiency, competence, and the shortage of other female mercenaries, Butterfly was offered the job of protecting Astrid, the youngest daughter of the Duke of Rose. She had completed numerous similar assignments, most of which required her to accompany noblewomen to different events, offering protection while dressed as a servant. Had it not been such a high-paying assignment, she would have chosen a far more exciting task, like hunting a dragon from the abyss, or eliminating the leader of a group of bandits. Anything else seemed a better alternative to entertaining a bunch of socialites, spending the whole night listening to their trivial gossip. Strangely, the new assignment was not as boring as Butterfly had expected. In retrospect, she was thrilled, if not overwhelmed, by the experience, as she was sent to protect Astrid in a fight against the Lokheim army that had defeated Arduin and the Vedan knights. After the deaths of her father and brother, and the siege of her castle, the young Astrid led the Knights of Rose into battle in the name of the Rose family. Butterfly was hired to protect Astrid, and when the fighting had finally stopped, both were left wounded and scarred from days of battle. In fact, according to the regulations of the mercenary order, Butterfly was entitled to abandon the assignment according to the contract's clause regarding “Colossal Changes in Assignment Complexity.” But she carried on with her duties, protecting Astrid in the absence of the late Duke of Rose, who never thought his daughter would have to go to war. When Astrid raised her father's sword, “Embertrail,” Butterfly’s assignment became almost impossible. But Butterfly did not back down, not only because it was her duty, it was also how she worked. “The word 'flee' is not in my vocabulary.”",

On the contrary, his people stood firmly behind him as he fought for glory. Ormarr had never disappointed his clan. When the Demon Army engulfed the continent, Ormarr volunteered to lead the campaign to defend his clan's fortress.

Her participation, skill, and magic, greatly bolstered the army's combat strength. With her outstanding contribution, Alice received the title of The Princess. Don't get on the wrong side of this little princess. This warning was always wise to bear in mind.

The priests of his tribe caught wind of this wicked plan, and knew they had to intervene. With their powers combined, they finally put a stop to his evil plans. Mganga, always the one to hold a grudge, plotted mercilessly against the priests for their tampering. The priests, seen as the divine light of the tribe, were hung from trees or slaughtered in their own caves… Overnight, the tribe was placed in serious peril. However, it appeared that Mganga's madness had pushed the powers of righteousness too far, and they mounted a counterattack against him. They swarmed him relentlessly, leaving him no choice but to retreat to the deepest parts of Dead Jungle. There, he took refuge amongst the venomous serpents and poisonous marshes. This by no means ended his study of black magic. On the contrary, he used his knowledge to communicate with dark forces, and now his mastery of black magic is greater than ever. The weak cowers before power, whereas the strong dominates it.",

Jinnar's ancestors solely relied on the orbs' power to defend themselves and to defeat the demons of Hell.  It was an infinite battle that never ceased. The more the orbs were exposed to dark forces in battle, the more they became tainted with evil. In order to seal the orbs, Jinnar's ancestors sacrificed their souls to protect future generations. The war against the dark forces inevitably continued and the seal loosened throughout the battles, making it vulnerable to be tainted by evil again. Jinnar took it upon himself to travel to the Temple of Light, a sanctuary in which the orbs would be safe. En route to the temple, the traces of evil within the orbs emitted dark energies to Hell, drawing the attention of Maloch the Merciless. Instantaneously, Jinnar was captured by his minions. In that critical moment, outnumbered and badly injured, Jinnar was convinced he was deprived of hope, and that, resistance was futile… until something awakened within the orbs.  The remaining soul energy from his ancestors was awakened, leading Jinnar to victory. Jinnar attained all of his knowledge regarding the orbs shortly thereafter, for he had heard the ancient stories of their capabilities but had never seen them firsthand. The orbs would finally be delivered to the temple. Using his spiritual powers, control, and knowledge over the Spirit Orbs, he gained unanimous approval from the temple to protect them. A newfound desire to grow stronger in order to better protect the orbs and future generations sparked. Lauriel aided him in practicing advanced Zen techniques, which he painfully withstood without uttering a word. Jinnar knew that the purifying power of the light obtained from the advanced Zen techniques could completely cleanse the orbs of their dark energy.",

As guardian of Holy Flame, Ignis has long relied on his abundant knowledge and unshakable faith to lead the faithful along the path of light. It is for this reason that he is widely known as the Guide. However, before attaining this status, Ignis was an ordinary Temple scholar. Obsessed with the pursuit of truth, Ignis spent all his time studying in the Temple's Tower of Contemplation. He read countless ancient texts, among which he discovered Holy Flame manipulation spells that had been long forgotten. Unfortunately the Holy Flame burned out a century ago, making his discovery worthless. Everyone in the Temple lamented this fact. However, Ignis was delighted. His study of the Holy Flame had brought him one step closer to the Kingdom of Truth that he had dreamed of for so long. Although it could not be put into practice, Ignis' discovery sent shockwaves through the forces of darkness that lurked just out of sight. No one could have anticipated that Ignis' next discovery had the potential to break the balance between light and dark. Commanded by the Lord of Darkness, a demon army mounted an attack on the Temple, during which the scorching flames of hell engulfed the entire Tower of Contemplation. The terrified scholars fled, but the resolute Ignis refused to leave. To protect the precious texts, he willingly endured the agonizing burns inflicted by the raging inferno. If this is to be my fate, then bury me in the Kingdom of Truth along with this precious knowledge! This sincere prayer invoked the power of a holy light. Ignis was shocked to see that the red flames of hell had been turned to a holy white by this power. It was the Holy Flame that Ignis had yearned to see for so many years. Although extinguished long ago, it had been reignited within him. Ignis recited a Holy Flame manipulation spell almost instinctively, and the Holy Flame formed a wall of fire, just as he had willed it to. The invaders will be destroyed. The Holy Flame will tear the flesh from their bodies and incinerate their bones! Brought to the brink of defeat, the Temple guard managed to regroup under Ignis' protection and emerged victorious. After the battle, Ignis returned to the Tower of Contemplation and continued his journey along the road to truth. Before truth, the knowledge I possess is but a drop in the ocean.",

He loved nothing more than pushing himself when in danger, and that was how he came to be known as the Peerless Warlord.  Lu Bu began to reminisce of his battle against Liu Bei, Guan Yu and Zhang Fei at Hulao Gate. It did indeed seem unfair to fight against the three of them, but Lu Bu was accustomed to these kinds of odds. Truth be told, it was highly unlikely that any other mortal could match him in single combat.  Tell me, am I the strongest warrior in the world?  Lu Bu seldom showed his gentle side as he shone resplendently in his armor. The enchanting Diaochan smiled sweetly at this, and fished out a note from her sleeve.  There may be no one in this world worth fighting with. But, my General, how about the opponents in Heaven? Would you care to battle against them?  In Heaven?! That's it!

True fear is reflected in the eyes of his enemies when they face his spear in action. His prowess in battles and tactical brilliance could not be denied by any, not even his greatest enemies. I'm not a fighter, Zanis once whispered. Even the wise Zhuge Liang, nicknamed the Crouching Dragon, noticed Zanis was growing weary of the battles. Zhuge Liang could not let Zanis' potential go to waste, so he continued appointing Zanis tasks and missions, leaving him no time to second-guess himself. Regardless of Zanis' feelings towards combat, they never outweighed his loyalty to the emperor or the love for comrades.  I may have grown weary of battle, but I'll always tend to my duties and fight whenever I am needed.",

This reclusive clan of ninjas loyally protect the peace and tranquility of the realm using the power of the ancient dragons. As the leader of a new generation of ninjas, Airi had not only inherited the title of Kunoichi, her incredible talents had also earned the approval of the Ancient Dragon. She has been bestowed with the almighty Dragon's Mark as well. As night engulfed day, the elite Ninjas led by Airi rushed to save the Temple of Light from the evil forces that surrounded it. Using her shadow clone ability, Airi passed with ease through the savage bombardment of black magic. The iron wall made up of thousands of Fallen crumpled beneath her feet. She transformed herself into a sharp blade and hurled herself straight at Maloch, the commander of the Demon Army, leaving a bloody trail of corpses in her wake. Airi took more and more wounds as she fought her way towards Maloch. By the time she finally reached him, she had defeated nearly all of his demon guards. Airi was punished for her actions with three more mortal wounds. With her strength depleted, Airi realized that she wouldn't stand a chance in a drawn-out battle, so she activated the last bit of power in her Dragon's Mark, raised her blade and sliced at Maloch. In that moment, Maloch was unable to lift his own weapon. He was so overcome by the unleashed dragon spirit that he could only use his demon wings to shield himself from Airi's attacks. The blade rose and fell. Blood hotter than lava gushed out from a wound in Maloch's chest and the impregnable demon wings were tattered. The force from Airi's blade had completely stripped the invincible commander of his combat abilities. Maloch was forced to return to the demon abyss to recover and, in turn, left the demon army their demise. Airi's determination, demonstrated in this battle, immediately earned her the respect of everyone. Even the most despicable of demons could not hide their fear of Airi's blade.",

However, none of the known systems of magic have spells capable of harnessing the power of space-time. Only an Andura Stone can contain the intangible power of space-time, and allow people to harness it. With the aim of acquiring this power, Murad's ancestors journeyed deep into the desert to look for fragments of Andura. However, Murad's ancestors were able to outsmart Azzen'Ka and acquire the fragments. They used the fragments to forge an extremely powerful weapon that could manipulate space and time, and built a new empire in the desert with its power. When Murad came of age, he inherited the weapon from his father and officially became the heir apparent. He led the imperial army on many expeditions, eliminating dangerous creatures and expanding the empire. This eventually threatened the authority of Azzen'Ka who was furious after discovering the truth behind Murad's weapon. But Murad paid Azzen'Ka no mind. As long as he had the weapon, Azzen'Ka couldn't hurt him. Azzen'Ka was forced to parley with Murad, and capitulate to the demands of the imperial prince. Murad gladly accepted his enemy's willingness to surrender, and missed the golden opportunity to rid the empire of a potential threat once and for all. No power lasts forever, and Azzen'Ka understood this only too well. From the shadows, he manufactured multiple crises that forced Murad to use his weapon to defend the fledgling empire. Overuse of the power accelerated the Andura Stones' decay and, unable to withstand the burden, the weapon developed numerous cracks through which the power of space-time leaked. This efflux greatly weakened Murad's ability to fight, and Azzen'Ka seized the opportunity to conjure a mighty sandstorm that completely engulfed the once prosperous empire. The weapon only had enough power to protect Murad himself, so after a plea by his father, he escaped the catastrophe. But he did not give up. He covered his handsome face and became a solitary desert ranger, seeking a way to repair his weapon while accumulating the strength to confront Azzen'Ka. Murad firmly believes that as long as he has his weapon, he will one day be able to kill Azzen'Ka and restore the honor and glory of his empire.",

His powerful fists could shake the courage of anyone who attempted to overthrow the dark rule. During the warring years, Skud was summoned to serve as Preyta's subordinate and lead the Fallen to charge forward. The battle for the Castle of Alchemy proved to be the pinnacle of Skud's achievements. Even though he had fewer than one hundred men, he successfully led them to break through the mechanical defenses that were laid by Moen, the arms specialist. Then he single-handedly destroyed ten alchemy puppets and fought his way into the castle interior. At that moment, Omega, who had been undercover for some time, issued an order to attack. Soon Skud and his men were flooded by a sea of steel. As he watched the Castle of Alchemy's defenses rose again and found himself surrounded by enemies, Skud became infuriated beyond reproach. The demonic blood in his body started boiling and his willpower was ignited. The iron blitz could not stall his progress. The strongest of armor crumpled like paper under his fists. The enraged Skud managed to single-handedly squash the enemy counterattack. Omega grabbed Moen and fled in panic, leaving Skud and his Fallen followers to enjoy the bounty of treasures and resources left by the army. When the battle finally ended, Skud got the reward he deserved: a set of alchemy gloves forged by Moen himself. Mganga made some adjustments that allowed the alchemy gloves to bond with Skud's demonic blood, giving him even more violent destructive powers. My blood boils in anticipation! ",

In a time when faith was scarce and demons ran amok, humans used technology to break away from being ruled by demons and became their own masters. From a refugee that could barely protect himself to a king that everyone admires, Thane has undergone arduous training, has seen dead bodies covering battlefields, has slain countless demons and has lost countless friends. But Thane never gave up, and he always led his troops through dark times, clinging onto glimpses of hope when there was almost none. On the day of his ascension to the throne, he earned enormous respect from his people. Even though the Temple was wary of his rise, and dubious politics overshadowed the capital, people still believed that Thane would be the one to lead them to a bright and peaceful future. That's why Valhein, The Demon Hunter, brought his people from afar and swore fealty to Thane. That's why Astrid, The Indomitable, risked the honor of her family and cleared the way for Thane to become king. That's why Raz, The Fist, became a spy and formed the resistance in an enemy camp. Human fighters have decided to stop fighting against each other and unite under Thane, combining their strengths to create a tidal wave that will push history forward and drive the demons back to their abyss. When a savage beast learns self-control, even gods should be afraid. Throughout all of this, Thane has kept his head cool, because when the horn of war is blown, he will lead the charge. With this sword in my hand, I will vanquish all evil!",

The only thing he cared about was instilling the fury of killing in all sea creatures. As for what they killed, well, that was up to them. Relentless slaughter served as the source of power of Kil'Groth's rage. Fresh blood diffusing into the seas aroused swarms upon swarms of deep sea predators which then filled the gaps left in the food chain. Such intense rage power was intoxicating for the demons. Taara, commander of the Fallen, wielded her hammer like the coming of a cyclone. She used the power of absolute zero ice to freeze the ocean surface. The water, which was heated by fresh blood, cooled and even Kil'Groth felt the effects. His pride, however, did not allow him to flee a fight. His raging will blazed and freed Kil'Groth from his icy confines. He picked up his massive sea blade and began his last charge towards the intruder. Many hundreds died at Kil'Groth's hands, but, under the command of Taara, the flood of the Fallen drowned him like a massive tidal wave. When the bloody battle ended, the dying Kil'Groth lacked the strength to even hold his weapon. In fact, if Cresht hadn't led the beast army to the rescue, Kil'Groth may have died there and become a legend in his own right. However, Kil'Groth recovered from his wounds and ended up joining the Forest of Shadows array to show his gratitude as well as exact revenge.

         "story": "On the dying planet of Krypton, an infant named Kal-El was placed inside of a rocket and sent to the distant planet Earth. The last alien survivor, Kal-El was raised by farmers-Martha and Jonathan Kent-who named their son Clark and infused in him the strong moral values that would give birth to the hero known as Superman. As he grew from a boy to a teen, and then into a man, the radiation from Earth's yellow sun allowed him to manifest incredible abilities, including superhuman strength, speed, and invulnerability. He also possesses the power of flight, as well as X-ray, heat, microscopic, and telescopic vision. Yet, along with his tireless desire to help the people of Earth escape calamity and reach their highest potential, came a sense of isolation.  Though he calls Earth his home, he is not of this world. The knowledge that his true home, the planet Krypton, is but stardust and solar debris, has kept Superman from venturing too far from Earth.  That all changed on a fateful autumn day, when Superman encountered one of his greatest foes. The villain Brainiac, supercharged with power from an unknown source, descended upon Earth with a fleet of advanced robotic drones. It took every last ounce of Superman's power to defeat Brainiac. The Man of Steel's endurance won out, and before dispatching Brainiac, his X-ray vision spotted something with a bright, glowing aura. Superman removed the glittering gem from Brainiac's armor and felt a surge of power ripple through his hand and up his spine. Immediately distrustful of the object's incredible power, Superman retreated to the Fortress of Solitude to analyze the rare artifact.  The Fortress of Solitude's computer could find no analog for the artifact's substance anywhere in the galaxy. However, there was one clue that the artifact found: a log from Kryptonian scientist Jor-El—Kal-El's father. Superman discovered that his father had been researching a similar artifact, which had been called an Andura Shard. This object, which could have given Brainiac the key to domination of the entire Earth, was only one piece of a much larger whole! The Andura Shard originated in a realm called Athanor, a place beyond even the Phantom Zone. Mainstream Kryptonian scientists had scoffed at Jor-El's assertion of the fact that parallel dimensions existed, and his boldest claim, that the magic which emanated from Athanor was linked to the physical universe, nearly brought him professional ruin.  But Jor-El was right. As Superman eagerly combed through the Fortress of Solitude's archives, he learned that ancient Kryptonians had explored the galaxy in search of the Andura Shards, and may have even visited the Earth long ago as part of their quest. But as Superman searched the Fortress of Solitude, it was revealed that Brainiac had redoubled his search for the Andura Shards and, if he claimed this ultimate source of their power, all of Earth would be in danger. Superman has already lost one world: he refuses to lose another. So the Man of Steel has taken flight across the galaxy in search of Athanor and the Andura Shards. On his quest to fulfill the legacy of his father, he will find himself cast as the defender of a new realm in desperate need of truth and justice.",

The hosts of Poison Fang cannot be killed, and the parasite can be passed onto offspring through generations. Natalya, a descendant of these warriors, also carried the parasite. When one of the tribe fell to insanity caused by the overwhelming power, the warrior was devoured, and his strength was absorbed by the rest of the tribe. To fight the external threats, the Temple quarantined the tribe to breed stronger hosts. Natalya happened to be the best descendant the Temple had seen in years. To appease her, the Temple even sent an emissary with extravagant gifts to her coming-of-age ceremony. What they did not know was that Natalya had grown tired of the humiliating quarantine and did not want to see her tribe falling insane. I will bear all the sins! She devoured her entire tribe during the ceremony to end their cursed destiny. With her head held high, Natalya showed her determination to break away from the Temple, for she knew very well that the root of the curse was the ambitious Temple. Natalya faded into darkness and managed to split from the Poison Fang with curses from the same school of magic. In exchange, she swore allegiance to Veera. With Poison Fang by her side as a loyal pet, Natalya held the power to rain destruction in her wake.",

         "story": "The Iron Mountain Range laid at the northern tip of the land, surrounding the Holy Hall like an iron wall. This renowned mountain range was known for its deposits of metal ore, which served as the main source of income for the Holy Hall.  As a group of people indigenous to the region, the Holy Hall directly governs over all of their faithful followers. The tribe led by Taara achieved many feats in the warring era. Though they lack the necessary crafting skills for fine weapons, they held their crudely-made hammers in valiance and smashed down on the invading Fallen at the foot of the mountains. Bloodbath after bloodbath, Taara's tribe paid dearly. However, even on the verge of losing the entire Iron Mountain Range, surrender never entered Taara's mind. On the day of the resurgence of light, Taara and her tribesmen held a great festival. They lit the furnace deep in the mountains and celebrated with pillars of raging flames. Thane's messengers came at this time, announcing the order of the new king; due to Taara's valiance in the war, she was conferred a noble title. This meant she now owned a wealthy piece of land in the new kingdom and her tribe was finally able to escape the life of material shortages and hard mining work. However, before Taara could plan her transition, Gildur's fury had spread to the Iron Mountains. As the Holy Hall's financial officer, Gildur knew that population meant production capacity, and he would not allow Thane to destabilize the cornerstones of the Order. Thane's messenger was exiled, and Taara was regarded as a traitor to the faith and imprisoned. In addition, the taxes for her tribe would be doubled for the next ten years as a punishment. Having the ground collapse beneath her, she fell from heaven straight into hell and endless torment. Veera, who had been spying from the dark, seized the chance to rescue Taara, leaving her with these words: False gods fail you in light; why not embrace true darkness? Disappointed by the Holy Hall, Taara submitted herself to the abyss. She was willing to be baptized by frost fire, and commit her soul to a dark will. I rely only on the power I can hold in my hands!",

However, none of them were ever able to attain the free, unfettered flight of a bird. The reason for this is Zill, a lethal danger hidden in the seemingly peaceful skies. The embodiment of the wind element, Zill can not only conjure devastating storms, but can also form the wind into razor-sharp blades that tear through even the toughest of enemy defenses. In the great war, Zill slaughtered dozens of marauding demons, earning him fame and admiration throughout the land. His remarkable martial exploits brought him status and influence. However, no one could understand why he refused the title of Guardian of the Forest of Shadows. He simply stated that the trappings of glory are incompatible with his free-spirited nature. When you need me, I will sever the heads of your enemies, tear them limb from limb, and drink their blood. But the free wind should never be shackled. That was the explanation he gave to Queen Tel'Annas. His unwavering loyalty and selflessness won the Queen's respect and trust. Before entering her slumber, she awarded Zill the right to exercise free will. Although this did not require him to undertake any specific duties, it allowed him complete access to the collective resources of the Forest of Shadows. Following this episode, Zill gradually faded from the public's attention. Other than the fairy Krixi who occasionally sensed his presence, no one else saw any trace of him. For a time, people completely forgot all about the hero who ruled the skies in the days of old. However, on the day of the Queen's awakening, Zill was the first to return to her side. For a thousand long years, Zill had given up the freedom he so desired to keep a silent vigil over the slumbering Tel'Annas. This was his way of repaying the unconditional trust she had placed in him. My blades will cut through any obstacle!",

During an ancient conflict between forgotten kingdoms, bodies began to pile high. Without time for proper burials, the dead were rolled into a deep ravine to fester and decay.  Preyta was the soldier tasked with guarding this area. However, as the corpse pile grew, the perpetual rot and festering corpses grew into something more. Preyta's soul became infected, his mind warped and twisted until all that remained was a servant of the plague. Empowered by the rot, a new creature was born. All living things were susceptible to the plague and Preyta knew just how well and quickly it could spread in time of war. Bards told tales of battlefields decimated by the purveyor of pestilence. He could appear anytime, on any battlefield, and rain down a putrid virus capable of consuming all life. Preyta could cause even the bravest of souls to cower in fear. Drawing powerful magic from pestilence, he could obliterate any shred of willpower that his enemy could muster before infecting them with a deadly pathogen.  He is the scourge, and he has returned to this world.",

         "story": "Batman has become a symbol of dark justice that hangs over Gotham City. Born into wealth as Bruce Wayne, he witnessed his parents murdered in front of him as a boy. This tragedy transformed his entire existence, reshaping him into the consummate crime-fighter.  Wayne traveled the world for a decade, training his mind and body relentlessly, pushing himself to the limits of human capacity, all in preparation of donning the mantle of the caped crusader. His years of tremendous effort have left him as not only the world's greatest detective, but with a physical prowess that has yet to be bested by any foe. As Batman, he has consistently been forced into battle in an array of alternate worlds, dimensions and universes. And it was through a bruising encounter with Zephys that Batman pieced together the existence of Athanor. Zephys collided into Earth, bringing with him a power of unimaginable magnitude. He had come to subdue the earth and build a new world. One that would be subjugated by Athanor and be forced to provide fresh troops for its eternal war. During the tumult, Batman found himself chasing Zephys, passing through countless worlds and fragments of time. Finally catching up to him, Batman sought to end Zephys' dark plot right then and there. However, he just could not find an opening to end the fight. Suddenly, the hero Valhein appeared, under orders from Thane, to investigate the strange rumblings of doom. With his aid, Batman finally beat back Zephys and temporarily banished him back to his realm. Traveler, welcome to Athanor, Valhein whispered in a deep, but urgent voice. Batman felt drawn towards this mysterious new land, to understand just what sort of role it would play in his destiny. Stepping into the light, he found himself in Thane's court. The resplendent king sat high above the rest as a gloomy pall hung over the room. He thanked the Dark Knight for subduing Zephys and handed him a shining gem, a fragment of Andura. Upon touching the gem, Batman experienced a vision of fire and despair. Gotham lay in ruins, consumed by flames that licked the air. Its inhabitants were being led towards the darkness in chains. The old and feeble were disposed of. The young and strong were ripped away from their loved ones and cowed. And above all of this sat a malevolent shadow that seemed to glow brighter than the very flames swallowing the city. Then, at a snap of its immaterial fingers, the light extinguished, and life existed no more. Batman stood unmoving, transfixed in the horror. This isn't real, is it? were his only words. This must be some sort of trick. However, the solemn shake of Thane's head and his mournful eyes, brought ice into the Dark Knight's veins. Thoughts raced through Bruce's mind. What is this madness? What is this despair? Thane finally spoke It is what will come to pass, if we sit idle. He continued, The Andura fragment you hold must be returned whole. It has the power to create, and a devastating power to destroy. It matters not where your world lies in time and space, all is connected to Athanor. And with that, Batman felt himself hurdled back to Gotham, to ponder upon the choices that lay ahead. Then with quiet and steeled determination, he fought. With Lucius and Alfred's aid, he modified his armaments to prepare himself for the coming battle. His friends worried for him. They were unsure of the threats lying in wait for Bruce. But as we all know from experience, never underestimate the Batman.",

Despite Aleister's intelligence, he didn't possess a strong will and he fell into the darkness due to Veera's charm. Though on a different note, Aleister's brilliance had a huge impact on the war. His endless tricks and traps helped the Fallen to defeat the resistance forces time after time. To eliminate the master think tank behind the dark power, Yorn left glory behind and led an elite team deep into enemy territory to assassinate Aleister. His near-perfect plan was foiled by Aleister, who turned the tables on him and nearly trapped him in the abyss forever. Are you smart enough to go up against me?",

Earning his favor, Raz was made head of a small strike team in Preyta's army.

He could smell a rat. He laid careful machinations to catch the traitor in his midst, even Raz was blissfully unaware until it was too late. While pursuing a false lead, he fell into Preyta's trap. He was immediately surrounded by an ocean of corrupted souls. Uttering foul curses, Preyta and his ilk closed in around Raz. He could sense that the end was near, but he could not just lay down and accept this kind of fate. Using his last bit of strength Raz lashed out with a fury never before seen in Athanor. His fists were on fire, lighting up his foes and his rage, until finally he broke through. However, his hands were badly broken and his spirit greatly wounded. Raz limped his way back into Thane's court where he collapsed onto the ground. To save his friend, Thane rushed Raz to the citadel and beseeched the angel Lauriel for aid. But in order to receive the Light's blessing, Raz would have to undergo a grueling trial, and if he failed, he would die. But luckily, he did not. Not only did Raz triumph and heal himself, he was stronger than he was even before.

It was difficult to say if Kriknak belonged to the living or the dead, because this being roamed freely amidst tombs, absorbing power by sucking out the essence of rotten souls, and yet it also had a body of flesh and its own soul. Of course, Kriknak was not concerned by matters such as life or death. The only thing it cared about was the orders from its master, Searcy the Banshee. As Searcy's devoted servant, there was nothing Kriknak was unwilling to do for its master. Even when it meant facing Claves Sancti in the hands of Thane himself, Kriknak stood strong in front of its master and used its proud horns to block any blow that came forth. These horns ended up being ruthlessly cleaved away by Thane, but Kriknak's loyalty was rewarded through Searcy's trust and gifts. Searcy, in turn, reluctantly pulled off her own horns to treat Kriknak's severely depleted energies, and transplanted them by infusing it with powerful spiritual energy. As the new horns took hold, the souls of Kriknak and Searcy converged completely. Even if they were separated by a thousand miles, Kriknak would always know what its master was thinking, and would spare no effort to complete any task it was assigned to.",

As the heir of a samurai, Ryoma not only trained hard, he also studied military strategy. In a training camp where strength was valued above all else, he stood out among his peers. The other children had suffered the same fate as Ryoma: their fathers slain, it fell to them to pick up the mantle and earn glory for their families. Ryoma was timid when he was young. This, combined with his peculiar hobby of studying military tactics, made him an easy target for bullies. But Kondo always stood up for him. Kondo had studied under Ryoma's father and wanted to repay the kindness that his family had shown him. With Kondo as his guide, Ryoma became a samurai like his father. Their friendship did not last forever, as orders from the military sent them on diverging paths. The courageous Kondo was chosen to become the personal guard of the kingdom's heir apparent, while one of the younger princes chose Ryoma for his cunning. Once fiercely loyal friends, they were now rivals serving their princes. Ryoma would never have guessed that they would eventually become enemies. After some time, the aging king passed away while dealing with enemies outside of the kingdom. The princes, both well-trained in the ways of the court, quickly turned on one another. Ryoma, now the chief military strategist for the younger prince, swiftly led the prince's army to several decisive victories. The elder prince, running out of options, concocted a dangerous plan to send Kondo's death squad to assassinate the younger prince.  The plan appeared to be successful as the squad reached the younger prince's throne without any resistance. Ryoma had anticipated this move from the elder prince, but was shocked to see Kondo and hesitated. Kondo and his squad took advantage of the momentary lapse and sliced through Ryoma's defenses effortlessly. By the time Ryoma regained his focus, he could hear his prince's screams as his father's words reverberated in his mind. There was no need to hold onto the past, and at that moment, he decided to give everything he had. Sword in hand, Ryoma sliced through every single soldier that dared come near the prince. It was Kondo's turn to be surprised, but he had no choice but to press on. Kondo's attacks became sharper and more deadly as he taunted Ryoma. The duel ended when both launched one final attack. Ryoma buried his sword into Kondo's chest, but Kondo's blade had stopped at the last second, inches from Ryoma's throat. Why? Ryoma was confused. I was always an orphan, said Kondo, I never had anyone other than you and my teacher. He'd be proud of y… Before Kondo could finish his sentence, Ryoma burst into tears. After burying Kondo, Ryoma snapped his blade in half and buried it with Kondo. He vowed to never again use his right hand, the hand that killed Kondo. He picked up Kondo's naginata and walked away. Glory and honor? The samurai code? That's none of my concern. From here on, Ryoma and Kondo are one, and we will start a new life.",

Facing frenzied beasts and bloodthirsty demons, the humans lacked not only the strength to defend themselves, but also guidance from the gods, which could have prevented their civil wars. This era of turmoil persisted until Arthur rose. Preaching principles of justice and honor, he started down the path of order and discipline as a knight. Arthur's chivalry was well-received and admired by all, drawing brave human warriors from far and wide to pledge their allegiance to him. Under his leadership, they formed a valiant order of knights trained in the art of war. They marched under the banner of justice and valor in the name of Arthur. They toured the land, exterminating evil along the way. Most importantly, they established order and peace amidst the darkness, ensuring humanity's survival. The deeds of the Order greatly impeded the demon legion's invasion plans. Arthur had become a thorn in Maloch's side, and his knights were attacked at every turn. However, the Order was not shaken one bit. Arthur and his knights resolutely stood their ground. Their resilience and persistence inspired all. Young men flocked at the opportunity to become a part of the Order. Any vacant positions in their ranks were promptly filled. This band of brothers, loyal to both the chivalric spirit and their leader gradually grew into a force to be reckoned with. Humans, long looked down on by the other races, were finally earning the recognition and respect of all. Even their age-long rival, the Afata, extended the hand of friendship to Arthur. The secluded Veda brought the blessings of the gods upon the Order and its knights. Arthur and his chivalric spirit gave courage to humankind and his successors, notably Thane, to pass on the torch from one generation to the next.

After completing the journey to the west, Wukong earned the title, Victorious Fighting Buddha for all his accomplishments, and he got to stay at Pūrva-videha to enjoy all the donations from the mortals. However, such a peaceful life was not suitable for the restless Wukong, who always thought about his days of adventuring on the Silk Road. Wukong had traveled thousands and thousands of miles by foot, and survived 81 tribulations. With the staff in hand, he defeated countless fierce monsters, increasing the body count along the way to the West. Wukong was never warm-hearted or well-behaved. Had he not been on Gautama Buddha's leash, he would have gotten into fights every day, even after becoming a god. When the crisis of Athanor spread to Pūrva-videha, Wukong knew that it was the chance he had been waiting for. Pretending to investigate the crisis, Wukong volunteered to head for Athanor, where he returned to his old self, alerting all heroes to his presence. As divinity tends to attract one another, Ilumia the Seer was the first to converse with Wukong. By her invitation, Wukong became one of the members of the Holy Hall and enjoyed the donations with the other deities. Ilumia promised that Wukong would not be bound by rules as long as he did no harm to Vedä. In other words, Wukong could battle any enemy hero at any time. I've been idle for 500 years. I can't wait any longer!",

Like many traders, he had always believed in the business principle of fairness. Once conditions for a trade were met, Slimz demonstrated this fairness by milking his business associates dry. Under the guise of being a successful merchant, Slimz ended up taking complete control of all transactions conducted in the border lands and became the ruler of this gray realm. After war broke out, Slimz recognized a business opportunity and persuaded the arms specialist Moen to build a Castle of Alchemy in the border lands. This castle would serve as a continuous supply of weapons and equipment to warring men, beasts, or anything else that could pay the price. After all, Slimz was a trader and neutral in the matter. Business boomed for Slimz and he accumulated an astounding fortune, yet the scope of the war grew larger and larger. To protect his wealth and the flow of his business, Slimz had the foresight to build a private army that comprised of wild beasts, men and alchemy puppets. Unfortunately for Slimz, it was Preyta, the supreme commander of the Fallen, who was the first to go after his wealth. Slimz fought tooth and nail and even enlisted the support of Omega, the Awoken Mech for support, but he was unable to save the Castle of Alchemy from its ultimate fate. His wealth, which took him many years to accumulate, was lost in a single night. Hungry to regain his wealth and status, Slimz returned to the Forest of Shadows and entered a new agreement with Tel'Annas, the Queen of Spirits: The agreement stated that the queen would mobilize forces to retake the Castle of Alchemy, while Slimz remained in the Forest of Shadows and protected it in her absence.

         "story": "You call that a gun?!? Were it not for his violent and stubborn temper, perhaps Moren would have become a scholar, quietly studying in a tower somewhere. But being a dwarf, Moren was born to drink and fight, preferring fists and bullets over words even when the debate was academic. As a result, no scholars wanted to take him on as an apprentice. This forced him to use his dexterous hands to forge another path: science and blacksmithing. According to (somewhat incomplete) statistics, nearly half of the most highly regarded weapons in the land were either crafted or modified by Moren. Therefore, everyone, from the mightiest of Gods to the most despicable of demons, holds him in high regard. This also meant that Moren was able to maintain a neutral position and, in some ways, remain above it all, for a very long time.  Slimz the Trustworthy sensed a new business opportunity in Moren's weapon forging abilities. After haggling over the price, the two eventually signed a lifetime contract. From then on, Slimz had complete ownership of all weapons created by Moren. In return, Moren received several precious mechanical diagrams, an endless supply of materials, and the Castle of Alchemy. This partnership made both parties extremely wealthy, but it also made them the new target of the Army of the Fallen. Following a joint assault by Preyta and Skud, the Castle of Alchemy suffered a devastating defeat. Slimz hoped to retain at least some influence, but he had nothing left to bargain with, and could not persuade the stubborn Moren to stop resisting. He had no choice but to terminate the contract and make Moren a free agent again. Deeply moved by this, Moren deployed his few remaining weapons at the castle and launched a final attack that halted the enemy's advance. Moren's actions enraged Skud who, in a devastating fit of rage, completely annihilated the castle's defenses and all but destroyed Omega, who had recently arrived to aid the castle's defense. Moren, who was seriously injured, attempted to detonate an incendiary bomb that would have taken Skud down with him. However, Omega dragged him to safety before he could detonate the bomb. Moren was grateful yet resentful. Eventually, he followed Omega's advice and accepted a proposal by Thane, the human commander.  In exchange, Omega shared with him the secrets of advanced mechanical principles, allowing him to create a new generation of high-tech weaponry.",

The only relevant knowledge that man was able to garner came from a bard's song: A monstrosity rising from the sea's hungry depths; its trident so terrible it brings naught but death.  In the War of Man and Beast, Cresht fought fearlessly on the front lines, endlessly tormenting the humans. Surprisingly, Cresht didn't return to the Boiling Sea after the war.

Speediness became a huge advantage not only in battles, but also in everyday life. With his speed as his weapon, theft became nothing more than a hobby to Fennik. Of all the thieves, he has yet to be caught and holds the highest bounty in the continent. There were only two instances in which Fennik was relevant and known universally by humans and beasts: he either raided their belongings or he made them worry about the moment when he would. The only people who condoned Fennik's habits were those who benefited from them. Those who were victims of his theft and those who were rewarded were not arbitrary, Fennik unintentionally tried to find a middle-ground between the fortunate and the less fortunate. Nothing pleased him more than seeing the chagrin on the faces of his wealthy victims who he had just stolen from and the gratitude on the faces of the less-fortunate when receiving unexpected gifts.

The Joker's belief that life can change at any moment drives his thirst for chaos, which has fueled his reign of terror in Gotham City. Believing that life is nothing more than a cosmic joke, the Joker has dedicated himself to showing others—the whole world, even—that in one moment, your whole life can get turned upside down.  The Joker has kidnapped, crippled, maimed, murdered, and tortured countless individuals throughout the world, but his locus of operations is Gotham City. Or, it was. In Gotham, the Joker was obsessed with the punchline to his best joke: the destruction of Batman's ideals. Yet, try as he might, no matter how agonizing nor how elaborate the situation, Batman refused to give in to the Joker's games. Even after the Joker's actions cost Batman some of his dearest allies, the Dark Knight would not break. Instead, Batman turned the tables on the Joker by utilizing a highly modified version of Scarecrow's fear toxin.  Prior to this moment, the Joker had never truly tasted fear. With Batman's altered fear toxin sluicing through his veins, the Joker was terrified for the first time. The traumatic nature of the experience was enough to unmoor the last fastenings of the Joker's sanity. Rather than stand trial for his crimes, he was committed to Arkham Asylum. Here, the Joker was a comedian without a joke. What could be truly funny in the face of true terror? The Joker began to despair that he might never laugh at the world ever again.  That changed when a new inmate was brought into Arkham. This man, too, was mad, but in between his demented ravings he spouted lucid streams of mathematical equations and whispered incantations in hushed tones. And when he would sleep, a single phrase was on his lips: Athanor… Athanor. The man's madness intrigued the Joker. With some charm and deception Joker befriended the inmate and learned of where the man had come from. A scientist in a former life, the Arkham inmate had studied radiation spikes across the world that coincided with paranormal phenomena. The scientist had found the answer to these riddles: a portal to another world.  The scientist spoke of this realm, Athanor, with reverent tones. It was clear that the experience had changed the scientist profoundly. The Joker was not in search of spiritual enlightenment or an experience that would cure his madness; no, he longed to see this world of beauty and order, so that he might make a grand joke of it. With his mind finally resolved to a productive endeavor, the Joker escaped Arkham, as he had so many times before. This time, instead of wreaking havoc upon Gotham, the newly freed Joker made for Athanor.  After months of searching, the Joker finally found the portal to Athanor. And now, even the gods who contend to rule that realm will have to wrestle with the man who is chaos personified.",

Lauriel fell under siege of the Fallen and suffered severe injuries. She was left with no other choice but to escape into the Dark Forest. This is when she encountered the forest guardian, Peura, who lent her a helping hand. However, Peura had no way to resist the destructive power of Aleister's magic. In order to prevent Aleister from succeeding, Lauriel handed the Fountain of Light to Peura and stood her ground so that she may escape. Aleister was very cunning however. He didn't give them any chance as he dropped thunder on them and turned them black and blue. I will drink this all before I let him succeed! The weakened Peura used her last bit of energy to drink the Fountain of Light and the light energy it contained burst throughout her body.

His speech was so affectionate and evoking, it attracted young and passionate rebel warriors to join his legion, fighting for a higher goal. Instructed by the Vedä, Arduin once regarded Thane as his rival. He decided to fight Thane for honor, but won Thane's admiration with his fearless combat style and confident tactics. After years of collaboration, Arduin finally accepted Thane as an ally and their friendship grew.  The duo was fundamental to the rebels' victory. The Fallen were forced to withdraw their defense lines and retreat to Inferi. In the last battle, Arduin and Thane quarreled for the first time in a long time. Arduin wanted to keep on battling, in hopes of obliterating the dark forces and bringing back the long-awaited peace, while Thane thought such an action would only devastate what they had achieved so far. Failing to persuade him, Arduin abandoned Thane and, together with his warriors and supporting Vedän squads, marched into Inferi to hunt down the remaining Fallen and demons. Yet, Arduin's legion was misled to the Icy Terrain by the cunning Veera. She ignited the frost fire, hoping to annihilate the entire legion. Feeling a deep regret of his own decision, Arduin strode through the frost fire and created a storm by swinging his ax, attempting to create a safe passage for his warriors. Thanks to Arduin's resourcefulness, a few soldiers managed to survive, but many of their fellows perished in the unforgiving frost fire. Even Arduin himself was scorched in battle, but was saved by the Vedä-blessed armor. Despite the fact that Arduin swung his ax blindly, he managed to kill any enemies who dared to come close. Veera swiftly stepped in and stopped the Fallen from taking revenge. She poured frost fire into Arduin's crippling body, rendering the holy seal of Vedä useless. Soon, Arduin's body was burned to ashes, and though his spirit remained, it was marked with a dark seal by Veera. Freezing frost fire replaced the Holy Force and became the sole driving force of the armor. Those who lament the loss of Arduin will never expect to see their legendary hero again like this!",

As one of the valiant warriors who resisted the first invasion by the dark forces, the legend of Tel'Annas and her unrivaled archery skills became the subject of numerous songs and poems throughout the centuries. Renowned for her remarkable deeds in the decisive final battle against the invading horde, it was Tel'Annas who shot the lone arrow that mortally wounded the Lord of Darkness, securing the survival of all living things that had lost the protection of the Gods in this terrifying episode in history. However, Tel'Annas paid the ultimate price when her body and mind were corrupted by the dark power unleashed by the Lord of Darkness in his final moment. She was forced to seal herself and fall into a deep sleep that would last a thousand years, until all of the dark power within her was neutralized. For the entire duration of her slumber, Maloch, the successor of the Lord of Darkness, tried to break the seal and take the dark power inside Tel'Annas, but the seal was far stronger than he imagined. Seeing his opportunity during the second invasion by the dark forces, Maloch ordered a massacre of the Afata, forcing Tel'Annas to break the seal and return to the battlefield. Her striking face bore not a trace of the thousand years that had passed, and her mastery over her formidable power showed that she was fully capable of manipulating the explosive dark power that coursed through her. Confronting the army of demons, spirits and corrupted souls, Tel'Annas once again drew her bow to defend the life and dignity of all living things. The radiance of the morning star will forever protect this land.",

But as the bearer of the famous sword Embertrail and the legitimate heir of the Duke of Roses, Astrid took up the mantle imposed upon her by history. She raised the Flaming Rose standard high and stood next to Thane, showing the world the allegiance of an old noble house to the new king. With Astrid's support, the doubts that followed Arduin's death eventually quieted and people started to reflect on the failure of Arctica. Even though Astrid's father and brother died in the war, she did not pay any mind to gossip and whispers from the Temple. Her support in Thane's ascension provided some much-needed stability in times of conflict. In return, Thane awarded unprecedented honor to the Rose family, and Astrid became the kingdom's first duchess. But before she could do anything with her territory, dark powers returned with Taara leading the charge. Arduin and Mina, corrupted by dark power, were spotted among their ranks. Astrid knew that the murderous leader was one of those responsible for her father's and brother's deaths. She could not wait to join the battle and avenge them, but Thane gently stopped her. Looking at the girl with affection and care, Thane said, You have done enough for me. I shall take care of the rest. My lord, I don't think you understand, declared Astrid with her head held high, showing resolve that no man of her age would ever possess. I took my vows as a knight. Dukes can wait in their castles for news of victory, but knights must charge into battle! With that said, she unclasped her crimson mantle, unsheathed Embertrail and led her knights to war. My resolve will never waver!",

It was a hive of activity during the day, but quiet and tranquil during the night. It was a place where people were sheltered from the hardship and misery of the world. However, the one thing the inhabitants of this serene place valued above all else was martial arts. Despite being a young cub, Zuka had to study all manner of combat styles and ascend through the grades by passing the examinations set by his teacher.  The young Zuka could not understand why he needed to do this. After all, why should he spend so much time and effort learning martial arts that he would never need to use? Surely it would be better to help work the fields or engage in scholarly pursuits? In response to Zuka's question, the teacher responded, It is not enough to simply wish for peace, one must have the ability to defend peace! Those words left a deep impression on him. When the fallen souls that emerged from the demon abyss spread plague and chaos across the land, the once peaceful village was mercilessly engulfed in the flames of war. In an effort to flee, the young Zuka embarked on a long journey with his family, crossing treacherous mountains as they made their way to the legendary Forest of Shadows. Zuka had heard about the Forest of Shadows in the stories told by the older villagers. Not only was it home to the legendary Elven Queen, Tel'Annas, but there were also countless elemental and orc warriors. They were the Queen's valiant army, charged with defending the land from evil. During the journey, Zuka witnessed all manner of depraved acts perpetrated by the fallen souls. The martial arts that he had practiced for so many years finally had a use. Wearing armor symbolizing his coming of age, and wielding a staff he made with his own two hands, he fought countless battles against evil and saved those who had suffered at their hands. Tales of Zuka's heroic exploits spread far and wide. From the noble and proud Temple of Light, to the Castle of Inception, which has long been suspicious of animal races, all factions publicly commended Zuka's heroism. Even Queen Tel'Annas herself prepared a lavish welcome ceremony in his honor. Then, at the invitation of Earth Elemental Lumburr, Zuka formally joined the resistance army, becoming a warrior with a duty to eradicate evil and protect peace. No matter where Zuka may be, he is an undisputed symbol of peace!",

         "story": "Wonder Woman is Princess Diana of the immortal Amazons from Greek mythology. When army pilot Steve Trevor crashed on the warriors' secluded island paradise, Diana won the right to escort him home and make her people known to the world. Entering the cynical world of humanity for the first time, Diana found a people who needed a hero. Over the years, the ways of mankind have vexed Diana—war, hate, and a callous disregard for the health of the Earth—but her superhuman strength, speed, bulletproof bracelets, and the famed Lasso of Truth have aided her in the quest to bring order to humanity's chaotic ways.  A warrior by birth and training, Wonder Woman fights evil while hoping to unlock the potential of a humanity she doesn't always understand—and it is this mission that has driven her to work in close concert with the Justice League. However, Wonder Woman's mission to promote peace on Earth is sometimes complicated by the political machinations and familial disagreements of her relatives—the gods and personas of Greek mythology. It was a message from her mother, Hippolyta, that eventually sent Wonder Woman to the realm of Athanor.  Hippolyta had kept a secret from Diana her whole life—a secret that now threatened to tear Mount Olympus apart. Hippolyta confessed that she had a passionate affair with Zeus; the resulting child was none other than Diana. But Wonder Woman had no time to process the emotional uppercut she had just received, as she was attacked by Hera, Zeus' jealous wife. The ensuing battle involved many of the gods, but Wonder Woman was able to quell the fighting by binding Hera with her Lasso of Truth.  Wonder Woman learned that Zeus had been missing from Olympus for some time—and in his absence, the gods were at war with each other, vying for control of Olympus. Zeus had left in search of the source of the gods' power: a star that was rumored to exist at the center of the universe.  Knowing that without peace on Olympus, Earth and humanity would be threatened, Wonder Woman took it upon herself to find Zeus. But Hippolyta cautioned that what she would find in Athanor would make all of her previous challenges feel like child's play. There were gods in Athanor, with strange powers and magic that would rival anything that Wonder Woman had faced.  But Athanor has never seen a hero like Wonder Woman. And when she eventually finds Zeus, what he tells her will have grave ramifications, not just for Olympus… but Earth as well.",

         "story": "Thunder! At my beck and call! Tulen was a demigod born to the call of thunder and lightning. He was an extraordinary child, able to bend thunder and lightning to his will. The thunder Tulen created was a thousand times stronger than regular magic. Some would call it godlike. Ilumia the Seer saw fit to place him under the tutelage of Aleister in order to learn the intricacies of his powers. Yet, the sly Aleister did not take a liking to Tulen. He sensed that Tulen would one day take his place, and thus decided he would teach Tulen nothing, not a single spell. Unfortunately, for Aleister, this method of teaching worked in Tulen's favor. His innate ability to control thunder allowed him to harness his powers without spells. While his vivid imagination propelled his powers to even greater heights. Tulen's success sent Aleister into a spiral that would eventually lead to his downfall. Tulen was not blind to his teacher's ploy, however. He had no intention of taking Aleister's place. Far from it. Yet, he also had no intention of giving anyone else the throne of thunder. He wanted the absolute freedom Aleister had... something a pupil like him would have great difficulty achieving. Finally, Tulen descended upon the temple with his godlike thunder and wiped away his teacher's sigil, burning his own upon the throne before stunned eyes. In so doing, he proved that he not only had the strength to take Aleister's place, but that the throne of thunder had already chosen him. Then, under Ilumia's guidance, Tulen successfully ascended the throne of thunder. His first task was to recapture the throne's previous owner – his own teacher, Aleister, for without Aleister, Tulen only held the title without the power. Tulen understood that this near-impossible task was given to him to curb his wanton display of power, but he didn't care. No one understands what I truly desire!",
